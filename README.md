# BooKart
Shopping Kart for Books developed in Angular JS.

BooKart is the One Stop Shopping Application for all types of books. It is developed in Angular JS. 
A Collection of Books is available. You can select your favourite, add it to Kart and then you can buy your books.
Angular's SPA is used rendered by routing.
Search functionality is available powered by Angular Filters to check out your favourite book. Proper configurations 
have been done for security, if user tries to enter through url will be redirected to the homepage. Angular Animation is used for better 
effects.

I hope you will love this Application.
